Gutach : increased safety for pedestrians
they are not even 100 metres apart : on Tuesday , the new B 33 pedestrian lights in Dorfparkplatz in Gutach became operational - within view of the existing Town Hall traffic lights .
two sets of lights so close to one another : intentional or just a silly error ?
yesterday , Gutacht &apos;s Mayor gave a clear answer to this question .
&quot; at the time , the Town Hall traffic lights were installed because this was a school route , &quot; explained Eckert yesterday .
the Kluser lights protect cyclists , as well as those travelling by bus and the residents of Bergle .
the system , which officially became operational yesterday , is of importance to the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstrasse junction .
we have the museum , two churches , the spa gardens , the bus stop , a doctor &apos;s practice and a bank , not to mention the traffic from the &apos; Grub &apos; residential area .
&quot; at times of high road and pedestrian traffic , an additional set of lights were required to ensure safety , &quot; said Eckert .
this was also confirmed by Peter Arnold from the Offenburg District Office .
